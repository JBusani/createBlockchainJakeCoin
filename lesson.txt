Key points to achieve and address:

we can create new blocks

but we don't want to create hundreds per second
and spam our chain


security: can simply change data in blocks and 
recalculate hashes

no proof-of-work

bitcoin: requires the hash to begin with a certain amount of zeroes
and it uses a difficulty measure to match the rate of speed computers 
have at solving it (or so). making it harder to guess
